                <p>This lyric humorously reflects the music industry's detachment from the band's identity, as they were often mistaken for individual members named "Pink." It satirizes the superficiality of the industry's understanding of artistic identity and the disconnect between artists and the business side of music.
                    <br>Such was the intellect and brilliance of Pink Floyd's songwriting. Down below are links to an About page where you can learn more about them and a Jubebox page highlighting some Pink Floyd's classics.
